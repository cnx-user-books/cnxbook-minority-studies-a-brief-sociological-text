  <md:abstract>Minority Studies: A Brief Sociological Text is a very, very brief textbook suitable for use as a supplemental or stand-alone text in a college-level minority studies Sociology course. Any instructor who would choose to use this as a stand-alone textbook would need to supply a large amount of statistical data and other pertinent and extraneous Sociological material in order to "flesh-out" fully this course.
Each module/unit of Minority Studies: A Brief Sociological Text contains the text, course objectives, a study guide, key terms and concepts, a lecture outline, assignments, and a reading list.</md:abstract>

Hyperghettoization is not a word that Wilson uses in either of the articles being reviewed here.

Basically the term means that “the exodus of black middle-class professionals from the inner-city has been increasingly accompanied by a movement of stable working-class blacks to higher-income neighborhoods in other parts of the city and to the suburbs . . .[leaving] today's ghetto residents [to] represent almost exclusively the most disadvantaged of the urban black community” thereby setting the scene for such pathologies as extremely high percentages of violent criminality, out-of-wedlock births, intractable joblessness, welfare dependency, and lack of job skills.</footnote></quote><quote display="inline"> 5) a severe lack of social organization; 6) poverty; 7) welfare dependency; 8) criminal activity; 9) unemployability.</quote><footnote id="id1170517604332">In David B.

The former refers to the constraints and opportunities associated with living in a neighborhood in which the population is overwhelmingly socially disadvantaged—constraints and opportunities that include the kinds of ecological niches that the residents of these communities occupy in terms of access to jobs, availability of marriage partners, and exposure to conventional role models. The latter refers to the presence of a sufficient number of working- and middle-class professional families to absorb the shock or cushion the effect of uneven economic growth and periodic recessions on inner-city neighborhoods. . . . the removal of these families made it more difficult to sustain the basic institutions in the inner city (including churches, stores, schools, recreational facilities, etc.) in the face of prolonged joblessness.<footnote id="id1170521504495"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid.</emphasis></footnote></quote>

      <title>A Piece of the Pie</title>
      <para id="id1170525139868">Stanley Lieberson’s article, “A Piece of the Pie” deals with the different paths taken (available?) to black Americans and white-ethnic immigrants since 1880. His primary thesis is that <quote display="inline">the new Europeans have ‘made it’ to a degree far in excess of that which would have been expected or predicted at the time of their arrival here. It is also equally apparent that blacks have not.</quote><footnote id="id1170525623085">In David B. Grusky<emphasis effect="italics">, Ed. Social Stratification: Class, Race, &amp; Gender in Sociological Perspective. </emphasis>Boulder: Westview Press, 1994. Pp 541-553.</footnote> Lieberson argues that migrants from different sources will have different opportunities for jobs—emigrants from countries with high standards of living will have relatively higher skill levels and will be able to demand relatively higher wages overall, than their counterparts from countries with lower standards, or black Americans from the rural, low-standard-of-living, post-reconstruction South. Furthermore, Lieberson maintains that Bonacich’s split-labor market theory applies as a controlling factor in the kinds of jobs available for new immigrants and Southern blacks. However, Lieberson contends that, because there are <quote display="inline">no solid wage data for the groups in </quote><quote display="inline">comparable work which also take into account the cost of living encountered in each [sending] nation and South</quote><footnote id="id1170518369216"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid.</emphasis></footnote> from the late nineteenth century from which to make comparisons between black Americans and white-ethnic immigrants. Lieberson uses, instead, life expectancy to compare standards of living.<footnote id="id1170525592750"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid.</emphasis></footnote></para>
      <para id="id1170521197076">In 1880 the life expectancy for male and female emigrants from South-Central-Eastern Europe (SCE) and for black male and female Americans was 27 and 29, and 22 and 26 years respectively. Lieberson’s life expectancy chart clearly shows that, from 1880-1920 the life expectancy of blacks is consistently shorter than that for white-ethnic immigrants. Current life expectancy rates strongly indicate that the consistent pattern shown by Lieberson is not only consistent but is persistent over time. Lieberson explains this persistent pattern by saying, <quote display="inline">if the European and black life table values represent differences in levels of living, then there is some reason to expect that the new Europeans might start off in a more favorable position that would blacks in the North even if there was no discrimination.</quote><footnote id="id1170523919119"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid.</emphasis></footnote> However, Lieberson looks beyond these “intrinsic differences” in order to determine <quote display="inline">why more discrimination was directed at blacks as well as why other forces have maintained these gaps.</quote><quote display="inline"><footnote id="id7502138"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid.</emphasis></footnote></quote><quote display="inline"> A major reason for racial discrimination against black Americans may simply be, according to Lieberson, that “social events have a life of their own; once established, the customs persist long after causes vanish.</quote><footnote id="id8424065"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid.</emphasis></footnote></para>
      <para id="id7736248">Once again, however, economics is the governing factor in the persistent discrimination against blacks, as Lieberson states, <quote display="inline">the racial emphasis resulted from the use of the most obvious feature(s) of the group to support the intergroup conflict generated by a fear of blacks based on their threat as economic competitors.</quote><footnote id="id1170518271903"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid. </emphasis>Emphasis added.</footnote> Moreover, as Lieberson compares the economic success and well-being of SCEs and American blacks, Lieberson makes it clear that American blacks’ playing field was inherently different and inherently worse.<footnote id="id1170520306675"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid.</emphasis></footnote> When one’s life chances are dictated by the color of one’s skin, and when those life chances are greatly lessened by the color of one’s skin, social pathologies, as Wilson argues, arise. We must never forget, Lieberson makes clear, that African Americans started out, in America, as involuntary immigrants—as slaves, chattel, property—and this simple fact, coupled with the <emphasis effect="italics">de jure</emphasis> discrimination of Jim Crow and Plessy, must be kept in mind when comparing the economic successes of blacks and whites in America.<footnote id="id1170521091718"><emphasis effect="italics">Ibid.</emphasis></footnote></para>
